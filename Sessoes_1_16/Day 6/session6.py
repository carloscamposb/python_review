# While loops 

# While is used when you want to put some condition in a loop to get a result based in a rule and you don't want to know about each element inside. It's different of for loop.

# The structure:
# while something condition:  
#     do this 
#     do that 
    
#the condition needs to be true once false the while loops ends.
