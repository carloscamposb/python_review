# Creating a band name: You need to gather information about the user's city and pet, then combine these names to come up with a new band name.

print("Welcome to the band name generator")

city=input("What's the name of the city you grew up in? \n")

pet=input("What's your pet name? \n")

print("The band name could be: " + city + " " + pet)
